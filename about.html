            Wash and cut the beef into medium pieces (about 3 cm). Put the meat
            in a saucepan with 25 cl of water. Then put on medium heat. Cook for
            about 1 hour. When the water has almost disappeared, add 25 cl of
            water and cook for another 30 minutes. Meanwhile, wash and cut the
            tomato into large chunks. Peel and wash the onion and garlic cloves.
            Then chop the onion and crush the garlic. When the water has almost
            completely evaporated, add 25 cl of water, plus the tomato. Cook for
            around 30 mins. After these 30 minutes, there should be just a
            little water. Add the garlic and the onion. And cook for 20 minutes.
            Watch closely and stir occasionally. In fact, the meat and the sauce
            should neither stick to the bottom of the pan nor burn. If
            necessary, add 1 to 2 Tbsp of water.

            Warm the water and pour in the baker's yeast. Mix well.In a bowl,
            mix the rice flour and wheat flour. Form a well and pour 3 tbsp.
            tablespoon sunflower oil and sugar. Crack the eggs and add them to
            the well. Gradually add the water while mixing with a whisk. The
            texture should resemble pancake batter. Cover with a tea towel and
            leave to rest for 5 hours. The preparation will swell and foam.If
            you see that there are a few lumps left in your mofo batter, do not
            hesitate to give a mixer to make them disappear. If you don't have
            mofo gasy molds, you can use round cookie cutters that you place in
            a pancake pan. You can taste the plain rice rolls or with jam or
            spread for the greediest.
